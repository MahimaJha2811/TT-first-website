            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a text-based approach to describing how content contained within an
            HTML
            file is structured. This markup tells a web browser how to display text, images and other forms of
            multimedia on
            a webpage.HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
            objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to
            create
            structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
            links,
            quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such
            as
            and directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as surround and provide information about
            document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to
            interpret the content of the page.HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as
            JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look
            and
            layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current
            maintainer
            of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language that instructs the browser how we want our HTML to
            appear;
            it is not a programming language. More than 95% of all websites on the internet today employ CSS to
            establish
            their design, making it highly crucial.
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
            document
            written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
            XHTML).[1]
            CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
            fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
            specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
            specifying
            the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural
            content;
            and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the
            file
            and its formatting.
            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
            styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser
            or
            screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the
            content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

            JavaScript is a scripting language for creating dynamic web page content. It creates elements for improving
            site
            visitors' interaction with web pages, such as dropdown menus, animated graphics, and dynamic background
            colors.
            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
            standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
            multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application
            programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
            and the Document Object Model (DOM).
            JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers
            and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
            Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two
            languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
            The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
            facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
            JavaScript is dynamically typed like most other scripting languages. A type is associated with a value
            rather than an expression. For example, a variable initially bound to a number may be reassigned to a
            string.[64] JavaScript supports various ways to test the type of objects, including duck typing.[65]

                        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
                        classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
                        Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin
                        words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
                        classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
